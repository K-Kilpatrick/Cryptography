# Cryptography
Module 10: Intro to Cryptography, Asymmetric Encryption and Hashing, Applied Cryptography and Cryptographic Attacks

Module Description
In this module, we will learn about cryptography, the art and science of keeping information secure using mathematical concepts and techniques.

The first day we will cover the history of cryptography, the difference between encryption and encoding, and how to use a tool called Open SSL to encrypt and decrypt a message.

The second day will continue the topic of encryption, exploring how asymmetric encryption can address challenges of symmetric encryption. We will also learn important cryptographic concepts such as hashing and digital signatures.

The third day we will explore how the cryptographic concepts learned throughout the week are applied to modern technology. We will learn topics such as steganography, SSL certificates, and cracking hashes with Hashcat.

Module Objectives
  
Day 1: Intro to Cryptography

Use basic transcription and substitution ciphers and keys to encrypt simple messages.

Understand how encryption supports secure communication through the PAIN framework.

Differentiate between encoding and encrypting.

Calculate the strength and efficiency of various encryption levels.

Use symmetric encryption tool Open SSL to confidentially transmit secure messages.

Day 2: Asymmetric Encryption and Hashing

Calculate the required number of symmetric and asymmetric keys based on the number of people exchanging secure messages.

Use GPG to generate keys and encrypt and decrypt private messages.

Use hashes to validate the integrity of data.

Use digital signatures to validate the authenticity of data.

Day 3: Applied Cryptography and Cryptographic Attacks

Apply steganography to hide a message within non-secret data, such as an image.

Use SSL certificates to help authenticate a website.

Use cryptographic attack methods to crack a password.

Use Hashcat to uncover the plaintext value of a hash.

Lab Environment
You will continue to use your Web Lab virtual machine for today's activities.

Username:sysadmin

Password: cybersecurity

Next Week's Lab Environment: At the end of 10.3, we will set up a new Azure Lab Environment for the Net Sec module.

What to Be Aware Of
On Day 3, during the Steganography activity, be sure to download the steganography image directly from your VM. Slacking the image after downloading it can corrupt the file and cause issues with the activity.

Security+ Domains
This module covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:

1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

2.0 Architecture and Design

3.0 Implementation

For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource: Security+ Exam Objectives

Module 10: Challenge
This module's Challenge assignment can be found in Canvas.

This week's Challenge assignment will reinforce the topics covered during the week. Ransomware has spread throughout a hospital, encrypting all patient records. To decrypt the records, students will have to solve six cryptographic riddles!

Looking Forward
Next week, we will move on to network security. We'll cover the ways a network can be attacked and the methods and tools that network professionals use to protect against such attacks.
